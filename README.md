# Simple Rust Query Engine

## 1. Project Description
(branch: master)

This repository hosts a simple, educational project: a minimal query engine built from scratch in Rust. It's designed to process basic `SELECT` queries on an in-memory database.

The core components include:

- A Parser that translates a SQL-like query string into a structured representation (an Abstract Syntax Tree).

- An Executor that runs the parsed query against our data store.

- A lightweight, in-memory data store for basic data management.

## 2. From Naive to Optimized: A Journey in Performance
(branch: perf/add-indexing-and-typing)

This project serves a dual purpose. We're starting with a naive implementationâ€”one that's clear and easy to understand but intentionally inefficient. This initial version performs a full, linear scan of the entire dataset for every query.

The journey doesn't end there. Our primary goal is to identify and address performance bottlenecks. By deliberately building a slow version first, we can effectively analyze where the system struggles. This will allow us to implement powerful optimization techniques, such as:

- Indexing: To speed up data retrieval and eliminate full table scans.

- Typed Data: To replace generic strings with efficient data types.

- Query Planning: To execute queries in the most optimal way.

## 3. Performance Improvements: BTreeMap Range Indexes
(branch: perf/btree-range-index)

In this branch, we introduced BTreeMap-based range indexes for columns in tables, enabling efficient queries using operators like >, <, >=, and <=. The executor was updated to leverage these indexes whenever available, falling back to a full scan only when necessary.

All internal row references now use RowId (usize) to maintain consistency and avoid type mismatches. The parser was also adjusted to remain fully compatible with the optimized executor.

These changes significantly improve performance for indexed queries while maintaining correctness for all query types.

This project is a hands-on exploration of the fundamental concepts behind database query engines, focused on the critical process of performance optimization.
